# Dashboard Update Summary

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Updated By**: Claude Code
**Task**: Update dashboard with real effort and function points for COBOL migration

---

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardService.cs - Migration Progress Update

**File**: `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/Services/DashboardService.cs`

#### Before:
```csharp
CompletionPercentage = 35.0m,
TasksCompleted = 79,
TotalTasks = 244,
CurrentPhase = "Phase 3 - Dashboard Implementation",
```

#### After:
```csharp
CompletionPercentage = 3.7m, // Real progress: 9 completed tasks out of 244 total
TasksCompleted = 9,
TotalTasks = 244,
CurrentPhase = "Phase 2 - Foundational (Repository Implementation)",
```

**Rationale**: Updated to reflect actual task completion based on tasks.md file analysis:
- 9 tasks marked as [X] (completed)
- 235 tasks marked as [ ] (pending)
- Total: 244 tasks
- Completion: 9/244 = 3.7%

### 2. Function Points Calculation - Enhanced Value Adjustment Factor

**File**: `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/Services/DashboardService.cs`

#### Before:
```csharp
var valueAdjustmentFactor = 1.15m;
var totalAdjustedFP = totalUnadjustedFP * valueAdjustmentFactor;
var estimatedEffortMonths = totalAdjustedFP / 50m;
```

#### After:
```csharp
// Value Adjustment Factor (VAF) calculation based on 14 General System Characteristics
// Higher complexity due to:
// - Complex business logic (COBOL sections with high cyclomatic complexity)
// - High data volume (100K+ premium records, 26+ tables)
// - Performance requirements (batch processing < 5 minutes per SC-003)
// - Multiple external dependencies (3 external modules)
// - Regulatory compliance (byte-for-byte COBOL output matching)
var valueAdjustmentFactor = 1.20m; // High complexity project
var totalAdjustedFP = totalUnadjustedFP * valueAdjustmentFactor;

// Effort estimation:
// Industry standard: 6-10 hours per function point for complex migrations
// Using 8 hours/FP for COBOL-to-.NET migration with regulatory constraints
var hoursPerFunctionPoint = 8m;
var estimatedEffortHours = totalAdjustedFP * hoursPerFunctionPoint;
var estimatedEffortMonths = estimatedEffortHours / 160m; // 160 hours = 1 person-month
```

**Rationale**:
- Increased VAF from 1.15 to 1.20 to reflect actual project complexity
- Changed effort estimation from FP-based (50 FP/month) to hours-based (8 hours/FP)
- Industry standard for COBOL-to-.NET migrations: 6-10 hours per FP
- Added detailed comments explaining complexity factors

### 3. Module Breakdown - Realistic Effort Estimation

**File**: `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/Services/DashboardService.cs`

#### Before:
```csharp
new() { ModuleName = "Premium Processing (R0500-R1300)", FunctionPoints = 85,
        Complexity = "High", EstimatedHours = 120m, Status = "In Progress" }
```

#### After:
```csharp
// R0500-R1300: Premium data retrieval and processing - Most complex
new() { ModuleName = "Premium Processing (R0500-R1300)", FunctionPoints = 85,
        Complexity = "High", EstimatedHours = 680m, Status = "Partially Complete" }
```

**Changes**:
- Updated all module estimated hours using formula: FP × 8 hours
- Changed status from "In Progress" → "Partially Complete" where applicable
- Added detailed comments explaining each module's COBOL sections
- All 7 modules now have realistic hour estimates

**Module Effort Summary**:
| Module | Function Points | Hours (Old) | Hours (New) | Multiplier |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Premium Processing | 85 | 120 | 680 | 8.0x |
| Policy & Product Data | 65 | 95 | 520 | 8.0x |
| Cossurance Processing | 75 | 110 | 600 | 8.0x |
| External Module Integration | 25 | 35 | 200 | 8.0x |
| Report Generation & File I/O | 45 | 65 | 360 | 8.0x |
| System Configuration | 15 | 20 | 120 | 8.0x |
| Error Handling | 18 | 25 | 144 | 8.0x |
| **TOTAL** | **328** | **470** | **2,624** | **5.6x** |

## Function Point Analysis Summary

### Unadjusted Function Points (UFP): 339

| Category | Count | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| External Inputs (EI) | 6 | 24 |
| External Outputs (EO) | 2 | 14 |
| External Inquiries (EQ) | 18 | 73 |
| Internal Logical Files (ILF) | 14 | 146 |
| External Interface Files (EIF) | 12 | 82 |
| **TOTAL** | **52** | **339** |

### Adjusted Function Points (AFP): 407

```
Unadjusted FP (UFP):           339
Value Adjustment Factor (VAF): × 1.20
───────────────────────────────────
Adjusted FP (AFP):             407
```

### Effort Estimation: 3,256 Hours (20.4 Person-Months)

```
Adjusted FP:          407
Hours per FP:         ×   8
───────────────────────────
Total Effort Hours:   3,256

Person-Months:        3,256 ÷ 160 = 20.4
```

## Impact Analysis

### What This Means for the Project

1. **More Realistic Timeline**:
   - Old estimate: 7.8 person-months (unrealistic)
   - New estimate: 20.4 person-months (industry-standard for COBOL migrations)
   - With 4-person team: ~5-7 months calendar time

2. **Better Resource Planning**:
   - Previous estimates would have led to project delays
   - New estimates align with industry benchmarks for COBOL-to-.NET migrations
   - Allows for proper team sizing and budget allocation

3. **Accurate Progress Tracking**:
   - Dashboard now shows real completion (3.7% vs inflated 35%)
   - Stakeholders have realistic expectations
   - Team can track progress against achievable milestones

4. **Quality Assurance Focus**:
   - 8 hours/FP includes time for:
     - Unit testing (90%+ coverage requirement)
