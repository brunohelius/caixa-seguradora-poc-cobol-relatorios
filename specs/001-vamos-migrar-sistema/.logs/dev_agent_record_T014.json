First, let me check the consolidated task plan file to understand the specific requirements.\n\nIt seems the consolidated task plan file for T014 doesn't exist yet. Let me check the main tasks file to understand what task T014 involves.\n\nNow I can see that task T014 is about configuring TailwindCSS with Caixa Seguradora branding in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`. Let me check the research.md file to understand the branding requirements.\n\nNow I'll check the current state of the frontend/tailwind.config.js file to see what's already there and what needs to be updated.\n\nNow I need to check if there are any checklist files to verify the status before proceeding with the implementation.\n\nLet me check the requirements checklist to ensure we're clear to proceed.\n\nNow I need to verify the project setup by checking for ignore files. Let me check if we're in a git repository.\n\nThe project is not in a git repository. Let me proceed with the implementation. Based on the task description and the research document, I need to update the TailwindCSS configuration to properly implement the Caixa Seguradora branding. The current configuration seems to have a basic setup, but needs to be enhanced according to the research document (R6).\n\nLet me update the tailwind.config.js file to fully implement the Caixa Seguradora branding as specified in the research document:\n\nNow I need to update the global CSS file to include the proper base styles as specified in the research document. Let me check if the file exists:\n\nLet me check the content of the globals.css file:\n\nThe globals.css file already exists but it doesn't match the specifications from the research document. I should update it to include the proper Caixa Seguradora styling based on the research document. Let me update it:\n\nNow I need to update the tasks.md file to mark task T014 as completed. Let me update it:\n\nNow let me run a quick test to make sure the Tailwind configuration is syntactically correct:\n\nThe Tailwind CLI doesn't seem to be available directly. Let me check the package.json to see if Tailwind is properly installed:\n\nTailwind is listed in the dependencies. Let me do a quick syntax verification of the tailwind.config.js file by checking if it's valid JavaScript:\n\nThe node command is running from a different directory. Let me run it from the correct directory:\n\nGreat! The configuration file has valid JavaScript syntax. Let me also check the globals.css to ensure all the Tailwind directives are properly formatted:\n\nPerfect! Now let me run the todo_write tool to complete the task:\n\nNow that I've completed the task, let me update the status to completed:\n\n## Files Modified\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/frontend/tailwind.config.js (modified, 18 lines) - Updated with complete Caixa Seguradora branding configuration including colors, typography, and theme extensions\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/frontend/src/styles/globals.css (modified, 33 lines) - Updated with Caixa Seguradora base and component styles following research.md R6 recommendations\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 1 line) - Marked task T014 as completed\n\n## Verification Commands Executed\n- node -c tailwind.config.js (PASSED - Valid JavaScript syntax)\n- grep -n \"@tailwind\" src/styles/globals.css (PASSED - All required Tailwind directives present)\n\n## Criteria Verified\n- \u2705 TailwindCSS configured with Caixa Seguradora primary colors (blue #0047BB, yellow #FFB81C) from research document R6\n- \u2705 Extended color palette includes dark/light variants and semantic colors as specified in research\n- \u2705 Typography configured with Segoe UI font stack as per research document\n- \u2705 Base and component layer styles implemented according to research document specifications\n- \u2705 Task T014 marked as completed in tasks.md file\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nTask T014 has been successfully completed by configuring TailwindCSS with Caixa Seguradora branding in the frontend project. The implementation follows the specifications from research.md R6, adding a comprehensive color palette with primary Caixa colors (blue #0047BB and yellow #FFB81C) along with their variants, semantic colors, and typography settings. The globals.css file was updated to include proper base styles for elements and component classes that use the branded colors. Both configuration files have been validated and are ready for use in the application.\n",
