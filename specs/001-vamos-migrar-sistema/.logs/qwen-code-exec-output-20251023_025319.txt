I'll implement task T019 to create a Docker Compose file for the development environment. First, let me check the consolidated task plan file and then proceed with the implementation.

The consolidated task plan file doesn't exist, so I'll proceed with the implementation based on the information from the tasks.md file and the project context provided.

Let me check the current task status in the tasks.md file:

Now I'll check if there's a docker directory or any existing docker files in the project:

Let me check the plan.md file to understand the Docker requirements mentioned in the project structure:

Now I'll check the plan.md file for more details about Docker requirements:

Now let me check if there's a docker directory in the project:

Based on the project plan and task T019, I need to create a Docker Compose file for the development environment. Let me first check the project structure to understand the backend and frontend locations:

Let me also check the backend API directory:

Now I'll check the backend project's .csproj file to understand its dependencies and build requirements:

Let me check the frontend package.json to understand its structure and dependencies:

Now I'll create the docker directory and the docker-compose.yml file with the appropriate configuration for both the backend and frontend services:

Now I'll create the Docker Compose file according to the specifications in the plan:

Now I need to create the Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend as mentioned in the plan. Let's create the Dockerfile for the backend:

Now let's create the Dockerfile for the frontend:

I notice that I referenced an nginx.conf file that doesn't exist yet. Let me create a simple nginx configuration file for the frontend:

Now let me update the tasks.md file to mark task T019 as completed:

Let me verify that all the files were created correctly:

Perfect! Let me check the content of each file to make sure they were created correctly:

Now let me check the Dockerfile for the backend:

And now the Dockerfile for the frontend:

And finally, let me check the nginx configuration:

## Verification Commands Executed
- mkdir command to create docker directory (PASSED)
- Files created successfully in the docker directory (PASSED)
- Content verification of all created files (PASSED)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ Created Docker Compose file with backend, frontend, and database services
- ✅ Created backend Dockerfile with multi-stage build for .NET 9 API
- ✅ Created frontend Dockerfile with multi-stage build for React app
- ✅ Created nginx configuration for serving frontend and proxying API requests
- ✅ Updated tasks.md to mark T019 as completed

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully completed task T019 by creating the Docker Compose file and associated configuration files for the development environment. The implementation includes:

1. A `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the services for the full-stack application:
   - Backend service: .NET 9 API with proper build context and volume mounts
   - Frontend service: React application with proxy configuration for API requests
   - Database service: SQLite container with persistent volume

2. A `Dockerfile.backend` that uses a multi-stage build process for the .NET 9 API:
   - First stage builds the application with all dependencies
   - Second stage creates a lightweight runtime image

3. A `Dockerfile.frontend` that creates a production-ready React build:
   - First stage builds and compiles the React app
   - Second stage serves the app using nginx with proper proxy configuration

4. An nginx configuration file that serves the React app and proxies API requests to the backend service

5. The task has been marked as completed in the tasks.md file

The Docker Compose setup follows modern best practices for containerized development, with proper service dependencies, volume mounts for persistence, and environment configuration. The configuration is specifically designed to support the development workflow for the Caixa Seguradora premium reporting system with both backend API and frontend UI services.
