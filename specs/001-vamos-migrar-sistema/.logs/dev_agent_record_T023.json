First, let's check the prerequisites and project setup.\n\nLet me check the project setup first by examining the directory structure and checking for any checklist files that need to be validated:\n\n let me check let me check for the existence of the consolidated task plan file for task T023:\n\nThe consolidated task plan file for task T023 doesn't exist yet. Let me check if there are any checklist files that need to be validated first:\n\nLet me check the requirements checklist to see if it's complete:\n\nGreat! The requirements checklist is complete and passed. Now let me check if there are any ignore files that need to be verified in the project:\n\nNow let me create the PremiumReportingDbContext file as specified in task T023:\n\nNow I need to check if there are any entity configuration files that need to be applied. Let me look at the current Data directory to see what configuration files exist:\n\nLet me check what configuration files exist:\n\nI need to update the DbContext to include the missing entities that have configurations. Let me check the current entities in the Core project to ensure all are properly referenced:\n\nI notice that the DbContext is missing the BatchJob and BatchJobExecution entities that exist in the Core project and have configurations.
