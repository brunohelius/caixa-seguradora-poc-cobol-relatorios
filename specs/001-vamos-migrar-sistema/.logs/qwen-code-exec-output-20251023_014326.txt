I'll implement task T003 following the plan. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.

Now I'll check the checklists status as required by the implementation plan:

Let me check the requirements checklist:

Now let me check the status of the tasks file to see which tasks need to be completed:

Now let me check the consolidated task plan for T003:

I need to create the consolidated task plan for T003 first. Let me look at the implementation plan to understand what's needed:

Since the consolidated task plan doesn't exist, I'll follow the implementation steps based on the project structure and requirements. Let me first check if the backend directory exists and create the Core project:

Let me check the src directory:

Good! The directory structure already exists. Let me check what's in the Core directory:

The Core directory already exists with some structure. Let me check the .csproj file to understand the current configuration:

Now I need to understand the task better. The task is to "Initialize CaixaSeguradora.Core project (class library) in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/`". Since the directory already exists with the project file, I need to ensure it's properly initialized with the correct structure. Let me check the Class1.cs file:

Based on the task description, I need to initialize the Core project properly. The current structure has a Class1.cs file which is just a placeholder. Since this is a Core library in a Clean Architecture, I should remove this placeholder and ensure the project is properly set up according to the architecture principles. Let me also check if there are any files that should be in the Core project based on the research.md and data-model.md documents.

Let me look at the existing attributes, entities, etc. that should be in the Core project:

Great! Let me check some of these files to see if they're properly implemented according to the research.md:

Let me check the CobolFieldType enum:

Now let me look at the utilities folder to see if the CobolMath utility is implemented:

Let me check the CobolMath file:

Now let me check the DTOs folder:

Let me check one of the DTOs to see if it's properly structured:

It seems that the core project is already well established. According to the task T003, I need to "Initialize CaixaSeguradora.Core project (class library) in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/`". Since the project structure already exists, let me make sure everything is properly set up. The main issue is that there's still a placeholder Class1.cs file that should be removed. Let me also ensure that any necessary interfaces are in place.

Let me check the Interfaces directory:

Great! The Core project is already well populated. Now I need to complete the initialization by removing the placeholder Class1.cs file and ensuring the project is properly configured. Let me remove the placeholder file:

There seems to be a path issue with spaces. Let me check the file again:

Let me try the removal with proper quoting:

Now let me verify the file is removed:

Perfect! Now I need to verify that the Core project is properly configured and complete the initialization task. Let me also check if there are any NuGet packages that should be added to the Core project according to the tasks list:

From the tasks.md, T009 says: "Add NuGet packages to Core project (no external dependencies per Clean Architecture)"

Since the Clean Architecture principle requires the Core layer to have no external dependencies, I'll verify that the project file is properly configured with no unnecessary packages:

Perfect! The Core project is properly configured with no external dependencies, which aligns with Clean Architecture principles. Let me run a quick build to verify the project is working correctly:

The build was successful with only warnings about nullable properties (which is expected and not critical for this task). Now I need to update the tasks.md file to mark task T003 as completed:

## Files Modified

- `/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Class1.cs` (deleted) - Removed placeholder file
- `/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md` (modified) - Marked task T003 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed

- `dotnet build src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/CaixaSeguradora.Core.csproj` (PASSED - Build successful)

## Criteria Verified

- ✅ Core project properly initialized with correct structure and Clean Architecture principles
- ✅ Placeholder Class1.cs file removed from Core project
- ✅ Core project contains no external dependencies as required by Clean Architecture
- ✅ All necessary directories and components exist in the Core project
- ✅ Project builds successfully without errors
