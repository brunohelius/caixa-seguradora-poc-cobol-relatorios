I'll help you implement task T026: "Add EF Core design-time services in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/Program.cs`"

First, let me check the consolidated task plan to understand the specific requirements:

It seems the consolidated task plan file doesn't exist yet. Let me check if there are any checklist files to verify the status as per the execution workflow:

Let me check the requirements checklist status:

Great! The checklist is complete. Now let me proceed with the project setup verification by checking for ignore files:

Now let me check if there's a Docker setup:

Now let me look at the target file to understand what needs to be modified:

Perfect! Now I understand what needs to be done. Task T026 is to add EF Core design-time services to the Program.cs file. This is required for EF Core migrations to work properly during development. Let me implement this step by step.

Based on the research.md and plan.md, I need to add EF Core design-time services to the Program.cs file to enable proper database migrations. Here's my implementation:

Now I need to add the design-time services configuration. Let me check the current structure again and add the necessary configuration for EF Core design-time services:

Now I need to add a design-time factory for EF Core migrations. This needs to be in a separate file as per EF Core conventions. Let me create the design-time factory:

Now I need to add the missing using statements to the Program.cs file to properly reference the configuration builder:

Let me create the directory for the Data folder if it doesn't exist (it should already exist based on the file creation above, but let me double check):

I notice that there's a file called `DesignTimeDbContextFactory.cs` in the root directory of the Api project. This is not where it should be according to my intended structure. Let me move it to the Data folder:

Now let me verify the content of the file in the correct location:
