  "implementation_output": "I'll execute task T013 following the implementation plan. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.\n\nLet me check if the project structure is as expected and locate the necessary files:\n\nLet me check the specs directory to find the task plan file:\n\nGreat! Now let me check the consolidated task plan file for T013:\n\nLet me check if there are any task plan files in the directory:\n\nThe T013 task plan doesn't exist yet. Let me check the main tasks.md file to get information about T013:\n\nNow I can see the task T013 clearly. Let me check the current state of the frontend package.json file:\n\nGreat! I can see that the frontend package.json already has the required dependencies installed:\n- React Router 6+ (react-router-dom: \"^6.30.1\")\n- Axios (axios: \"^1.12.2\")\n- Recharts (recharts: \"^3.3.0\")\n- TailwindCSS (tailwindcss: \"^3.4.18\")\n\nLet me check the current status of the checklists:\n\nLet me check the requirements checklist to see its status:\n\nNow let me check if there's a .gitignore file in the frontend directory to verify project setup:\n\nPerfect! I can see that task T013 is already marked as completed in the tasks.md file, and all the required dependencies are already installed in the frontend package.json. Let me verify that all dependencies mentioned in the task are properly installed:\n\n1. React Router 6+ - \u2713 (react-router-dom: \"^6.30.1\")\n2. Axios - \u2713 (axios: \"^1.12.2\")\n3. Recharts - \u2713 (recharts: \"^3.3.0\")\n4. TailwindCSS - \u2713 (tailwindcss: \"^3.4.18\")\n\nLet me also check if there are additional dependencies mentioned in the plan that might be needed:\n\nNow I'll check the quickstart.md file to see if there are any additional dependencies to install:\n\nLet me read the rest of the quickstart.md file to see if there are any additional frontend dependencies mentioned:\n\nBased on my analysis of the project files, I can see that task T013 is about installing frontend dependencies (React Router 6+, Axios, Recharts, TailwindCSS) in `frontend/package.json`. Looking at the current package.json file, I can confirm that all the required dependencies are already installed:\n\n1. React Router: \"^6.30.1\" (React Router 6+)\n2. Axios: \"^1.12.2\"\n3. Recharts: \"^3.3.0\"\n4. TailwindCSS: \"^3.4.18\"\n\nThe task is already completed, as shown in the tasks.md file where T013 is marked as [x] complete. Let me update the tasks file to reflect this:\n\n## Files Modified\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/frontend/package.json (read, 38 lines) - Verified dependencies were already installed\n\n## Verification Commands Executed\n- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/frontend/package.json (CONFIRMED - Dependencies already present)\n\n## Criteria Verified\n- \u2705 React Router 6+ installed (react-router-dom: \"^6.30.1\") - Available in package.json\n- \u2705 Axios installed (axios: \"^1.12.2\") - Available in package.json\n- \u2705 Recharts installed (recharts: \"^3.3.0\") - Available in package.json\n- \u2705 TailwindCSS installed (tailwindcss: \"^3.4.18\") - Available in package.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"T013\",\n  \"implementation_summary\": \"Verified that all required frontend dependencies (React Router 6+, Axios, Recharts, TailwindCSS) were already installed in the frontend/package.json file.
