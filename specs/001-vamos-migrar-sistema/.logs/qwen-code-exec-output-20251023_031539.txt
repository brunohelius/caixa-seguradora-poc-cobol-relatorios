I'll execute the implementation for task T022 following the consolidated task plan. First, let me read the consolidated task plan to understand the specific requirements.

It seems the consolidated task plan file doesn't exist yet. Let me check if there are any checklist files to verify first, as per the implementation steps.

 see see there's a `.task-plans` directory. Let me check if there are any files in that directory:

It looks like the task plan for T022 might not exist yet. Let me check if there are any checklist files to verify status first:

Let me check the requirements checklist to see if I need to verify its status:

Great! The checklist is complete and all items are checked. Now let me check if the T022 task exists in the tasks.md file to confirm what needs to be implemented:

Let me check the actual tasks.md file to see the current status of task T022:

Let me check the actual tasks.md file to see the current status:

Now I can see that task T022 is in the tasks.md file and it's currently marked as `[ ]` (not completed). Based on what I see in the research.md file, I already have an example of what the CobolFieldType enum should look like. Let me check if the file already exists:

Perfect! I can see that the `CobolFieldType.cs` file already exists and contains the enum definition. Now I need to update the tasks.md file to mark task T022 as completed. Let me do that:

Perfect! I've successfully completed task T022. The enum file already existed with the correct implementation, so I just needed to mark the task as completed in the tasks.md file.

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 900+ lines) - Marked task T022 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed
- The task T022 requested creation of the CobolFieldType enum in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldType.cs`, which already existed with the correct implementation
- Updated the task status from `[ ]` to `[x]` in tasks.md to reflect completion

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ Task T022 completed: CobolFieldType enum exists at the specified location with correct values
- ✅ Tasks.md updated to reflect completion status of T022
