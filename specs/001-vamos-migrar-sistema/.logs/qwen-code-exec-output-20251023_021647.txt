I'll help you implement task T008: Add NuGet packages to Api project (Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper). Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.

I'll check the project prerequisites and setup first.

Now let me check the checklist status as required by the implementation workflow:

Let me check the status of the requirements checklist:

Great! All checklists are complete. Now let me read the consolidated task plan for T008:

The consolidated task plan for T008 doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to understand the current task:

Now I'll check the project structure to understand the current setup and where I need to add the NuGet packages:

Now I'll check the Api project to see the current packages:

Perfect! I can see that the packages mentioned in task T008 (Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper) have already been added to the Api project:

1. Swashbuckle: `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` Version="9.0.6"
2. Serilog: Multiple packages including `Serilog.AspNetCore`, `Serilog.Sinks.Console`, and `Serilog.Sinks.File`
3. AutoMapper: `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection` Version="12.0.1"

Let me update the task status in the tasks.md file to mark T008 as completed:

Now let me verify what packages are installed by checking the other project files mentioned in the tasks as well:

I'll also check the test projects as mentioned in task T011:

Great! I've confirmed that the packages for task T008 have already been added to the Api project. Let me update the todos to reflect that the task is completed:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 551 lines) - Updated task T008 status from [ ] to [x]
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/CaixaSeguradora.Api.csproj (read, 21 lines) - Verified NuGet packages were already present

## Verification Commands Executed
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (Confirmed task T008 marked as [x])
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/CaixaSeguradora.Api.csproj (Confirmed Swashbuckle, Serilog, and AutoMapper packages present)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ T008 task marked as completed in tasks.md: Swashbuckle, Serilog, and AutoMapper packages already added to Api project
- ✅ Package verification: All required packages (Swashbuckle.AspNetCore, Serilog.AspNetCore, Serilog.Sinks.Console, Serilog.Sinks.File, AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection) are present in the .csproj file
