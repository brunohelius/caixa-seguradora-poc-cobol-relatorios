I'll execute task T012: Create React + Vite + TypeScript project structure in `frontend/` using `npm create vite @latest`. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.

I need to check the consolidated task plan file as mentioned in the instructions. Let me look for it:

Let me check if there are any task plan files for T012 specifically:

Let me check the current tasks.md file to understand what T012 is about:

Now I can see that task T012 is about creating the React + Vite + TypeScript project structure in the `frontend/` directory. Since there's no specific task plan file for T012, I'll need to create the React project structure as specified. Let me first check the current state of the project to see if the frontend directory already exists:

I can see that there's already a `frontend` directory. Let me check what's inside it to determine if I need to create a new React Vite project or if one already exists:

I can see that there's already a React project created in the frontend directory with Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and other configuration files. Let me check the package.json to confirm what's installed:

Perfect! I can see that the frontend project already exists and has React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and other necessary dependencies installed. The project has been created with the proper stack (React + Vite + TypeScript).

Since the task T012 is to "Create React + Vite + TypeScript project structure in `frontend/` using `npm create vite@latest`", and I can see that this has already been done (the project exists with all the required files), I'll mark this task as completed in the tasks.md file.

Let me also check a few key files to confirm the project structure is properly set up:

Now I'll update the tasks.md file to mark T012 as completed:

Let me also run the frontend development server to confirm everything is working properly:

Let me try with the full path:

Let me check the status of the server:

Perfect! The frontend development server is running on port 5173. Now I'll stop the server since we just needed to verify that the React + Vite + TypeScript project structure is properly created:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 291 lines) - Marked task T012 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed
- npm run dev -- --port 5173 --host 0.0.0.0 (VERIFIED - Frontend server started successfully on port 5173)
- lsof -i :5173 (VERIFIED - Confirmed server process running on port 5173)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ React + Vite + TypeScript project already existed in frontend/ directory
- ✅ Project has proper configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, package.json)
- ✅ Required dependencies installed (react, react-dom, typescript, vite, etc.)
- ✅ Frontend development server runs successfully
- ✅ Task T012 marked as completed in tasks.md
