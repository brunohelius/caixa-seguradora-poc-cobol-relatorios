Let me check if there are any checklist files to verify the status as per the execution workflow:\n\nLet me check the requirements checklist status:\n\nGreat! The checklist is complete. Now let me proceed with the project setup verification by checking for ignore files:\n\nNow let me check if there's a Docker setup:\n\nNow let me look at the target file to understand what needs to be modified:\n\nPerfect! Now I understand what needs to be done. Task T026 is to add EF Core design-time services to the Program.cs file. This is required for EF Core migrations to work properly during development. Let me implement this step by step.\n\nBased on the research.md and plan.md, I need to add EF Core design-time services to the Program.cs file to enable proper database migrations. Here's my implementation:\n\nNow I need to add the design-time services configuration. Let me check the current structure again and add the necessary configuration for EF Core design-time services:\n\nNow I need to add a design-time factory for EF Core migrations. This needs to be in a separate file as per EF Core conventions. Let me create the design-time factory:\n\nNow I need to add the missing using statements to the Program.cs file to properly reference the configuration builder:\n\nLet me create the directory for the Data folder if it doesn't exist (it should already exist based on the file creation above, but let me double check):\n\nI notice that there's a file called `DesignTimeDbContextFactory.cs` in the root directory of the Api project. This is not where it should be according to my intended structure. Let me move it to the Data folder:\n\nNow let me verify the content of the file in the correct location:\n\n\n",
