I'll help you execute the implementation for task T002. First, let me run the prerequisite checks.

Now let me check if there are any checklists that need to be verified:

Let me check the status of the requirements checklist:

Now let me verify the project setup by checking if this is a git repository and create/verify necessary ignore files:

Let me check if there's already a .gitignore file:

Great! Now let me read the consolidated task plan for T002:

The consolidated task plan file doesn't exist yet. Let me check if there's a general task plan file:

I see that only task T001 has a plan file. Let me look at the tasks.md file to understand the task T002:

Now let me check the plan.md file to understand the technical context:

Now I'll create the task plan for T002 by following the implementation requirements. Let me first check if the backend directory exists and then initialize the CaixaSeguradora.Api project:

Now I'll create the CaixaSeguradora.Api project with ASP.NET Core Web API 9.0:

It looks like the directory already exists. Let me check what's in the backend/src directory:

I see the CaixaSeguradora.Api project already exists. Let me check its contents:

Let me check the .csproj file to see if it's properly configured for ASP.NET Core Web API 9.0:

Perfect! The project is already created and configured with the right TargetFramework (net9.0) and the necessary packages for Web API, including the ones mentioned in the tasks (Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper). Let me also check the Program.cs file:

Now let me also check the appsettings.json to see the configuration:

I can see that the CaixaSeguradora.Api project has already been created and is more advanced than just a basic Web API. It already includes the necessary packages and configuration for our project. Let me update the tasks.md file to mark task T002 as completed:

Let me also run a quick test to verify that the project builds correctly:

Perfect! The project builds successfully. Now let me create the consolidated task plan file for T002:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 300 lines) - Marked task T002 as completed
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/.task-plans/task-T002.md (created, 80 lines) - Created consolidated task plan for T002

## Verification Commands Executed
- dotnet build (PASSED - Project built successfully with warnings but no errors)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ Task T002: Initialize CaixaSeguradora.Api project with ASP.NET Core Web API 9.0 in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/` - Project was already created and properly configured for .NET 9.0
- ✅ Project targets .NET 9.0 framework - Verified in .csproj file
- ✅ Required packages included - Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper are all referenced
- ✅ Project builds successfully - Verified with dotnet build command
