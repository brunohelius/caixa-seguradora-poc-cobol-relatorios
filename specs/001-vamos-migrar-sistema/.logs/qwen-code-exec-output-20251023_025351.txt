I'll implement task T017, which is to create a `.gitignore` file for the backend project. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.

I'll check the prerequisites and project setup first.

Now I'll check if there are any checklists that need to be completed:

Let me check the content of the requirements checklist:

Great! The checklist is complete. Now let me continue with the implementation. I need to verify the project setup and create the .gitignore file for the backend .NET project.

Let me first check if the backend directory exists and understand the project structure:

I see there's already a .gitignore file at the root. Let me check its content:

Now let me check the backend directory structure to see if it needs its own .gitignore file:

I can see that there's already a .gitignore file in the backend directory. Let me check its content:

Perfect! I can see that the backend directory already has a .gitignore file with .NET-specific patterns including bin/, obj/, and *.db as required by task T017. However, let me check the consolidated task plan to see if there are specific requirements for this task:

The consolidated task plan file doesn't exist. Let me check the tasks.md file to see the details of task T017:

I can see that task T017 is actually already marked as completed in the tasks.md file (it has [x]). Let me double-check the content of the existing .gitignore file to ensure it has all the required patterns mentioned in the task:

The task required: `Create 'backend/.gitignore' for .NET projects (bin/, obj/, *.db)`

Looking at the current .gitignore file, I can see it already has:
- `bin/` ✓
- `obj/` ✓ 
- `*.db` ✓ (along with `*.db-shm` and `*.db-wal` which are related SQLite files)

The file is already created with all the required patterns. Let me update the task status in the todo list:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore (verified, 30 lines) - Contains required .NET patterns: bin/, obj/, *.db

## Verification Commands Executed
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore (VERIFIED - contains all required patterns)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ .gitignore file exists in backend directory: File contains .NET-specific ignore patterns
- ✅ Required patterns present: bin/, obj/, and *.db are all included in the file

The task T017 was to create a .gitignore file for the backend .NET project with the patterns bin/, obj/, and *.db. I verified that this file already exists at `/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore` and it already contains all the required patterns mentioned in the task. The task was already marked as completed [x] in the tasks.md file.
