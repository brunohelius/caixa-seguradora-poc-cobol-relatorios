I'll implement task T009 as requested. Let me first check the consolidated task plan file and follow the implementation steps.

Let me check if there's a consolidated task plan file in a different location:

I notice that the file for task T009 doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to understand what task T009 is supposed to do:

Now I'll check the project structure to understand where the Core project is located and what packages need to be added:

I'll check the current project file to see what packages are already added:

Now I'll check the plan.md file to see what Clean Architecture principles were established for the Core project:

Based on the research.md and plan.md files, I understand that according to Clean Architecture principles, the Core project should have no external dependencies. However, I noticed that T009 task is marked as already complete in the tasks.md file (with a [x]), but it seems to be incorrect. Let me check the research.md file to understand what packages may be needed:

Based on the information I've gathered, I need to check the current status more carefully. I see that in the tasks.md file, task T009 is marked as completed with a `[x]`, but the description says "Add NuGet packages to Core project (no external dependencies per Clean Architecture)". Let me check if there might be an issue with the marking, since the instruction is specifically asking me to implement task T009. Let me also check the status of nearby tasks to understand the context better:

Looking at the tasks.md file, I see that T009 is marked as [ ] (not completed) in the actual file despite what was mentioned earlier. The task is "Add NuGet packages to Core project (no external dependencies per Clean Architecture)". However, according to Clean Architecture principles, the Core layer should have no external dependencies.

Let me look at the current project file to see if any packages have been added:

Based on the Clean Architecture principles mentioned in the plan.md and research.md, the Core project should indeed have no external dependencies. However, I notice there might be some inconsistency in the requirements - the task T009 description says "no external dependencies per Clean Architecture" while asking to add NuGet packages.

Looking more carefully at the task, it's clear that according to Clean Architecture principles, the Core layer should remain independent without external dependencies. So in this case, implementing task T009 means not adding any external packages but maintaining the project as is with only the basic .NET 9 framework.

Let me update the task status in the tasks.md file:

Now I need to think about this more carefully. The task description seems contradictory - it says "Add NuGet packages to Core project (no external dependencies per Clean Architecture)". Based on Clean Architecture, the Core layer should indeed have no external dependencies. But T010 was already marked as completed and it added packages to the Infrastructure project, which is correct.

Let me check if there are any specific attributes or utilities needed in the Core project based on the research.md. Looking at the research, I see that there's a CobolFieldAttribute and CobolMath class mentioned that might need to be in the Core project. Let me verify if there are any NuGet packages required for these features.

Based on the research.md, there are custom attributes that need to be implemented in the Core project based on the type mapping strategy (R1). Let me check if these have been created yet:

Great! Let me check what's in these files to see if they require any additional NuGet packages:

Perfect! These files already exist and they don't require any external NuGet packages. They only use built-in .NET attributes and enums. This confirms that the Core project indeed doesn't need any external dependencies as per Clean Architecture principles.

Looking back at the original task description: "Add NuGet packages to Core project (no external dependencies per Clean Architecture)". This is actually a bit of a misnomer - the task is to verify that the Core project has no external dependencies, which aligns with Clean Architecture.

Let me also verify if there's a CobolMath utility class that might need implementation based on the research:

I can see that this file has been created and it uses the CobolRoundMode enum, but it's defined within the same file. This utility class doesn't require any additional NuGet packages - it only uses built-in .NET System namespace.

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 1453 lines) - Marked task T009 as completed in tasks.md

## Verification Commands Executed
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/CaixaSeguradora.Core.csproj (VERIFIED - project file has no external NuGet packages)
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldAttribute.cs (VERIFIED - implemented without external dependencies)
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldType.cs (VERIFIED - implemented without external dependencies)
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Utilities/CobolMath.cs (VERIFIED - implemented without external dependencies)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ T009 completed: Verified that Core project has no external NuGet dependencies (maintains Clean Architecture principles)
- ✅ Core project maintains independence: All required utilities and attributes are implemented with built-in .NET features
- ✅ Clean Architecture compliance: Core layer remains independent from Infrastructure and External dependencies
