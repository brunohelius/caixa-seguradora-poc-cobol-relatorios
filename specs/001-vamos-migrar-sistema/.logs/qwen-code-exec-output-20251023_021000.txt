I'll help you execute task T006 according to the implementation plan. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and analyzing the project structure.

Now let me check the checklist status as required by the implementation guidelines:

Let me read the checklist file to check the status:

Great! All checklists are complete. Now I'll proceed with the project setup verification to check if we have the necessary ignore files:

Now I'll check if a .gitignore file exists and create/verify it:

Perfect! Now let me read the consolidated task plan for T006:

Let me check if the task plan exists in another location or if I need to create it:

I see that there are task files for T001 and T002, but not for T006. Let me read the current tasks.md file to understand the current task:

Now I'll check the plan.md file to understand the technical requirements for the task:

Now I'll check the research.md file to understand the technical requirements for the task:

Now I'll create the implementation plan for task T006. First, let me check if there are any similar task files to model my implementation after:

Now I need to check the backend directory structure to understand the current state and what needs to be done for task T006:

Let me check the tests directory to see if the integration tests project already exists:

Great! I can see that the `CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests` directory already exists. Let me check what's inside it to understand the current state:

Let me check the content of the project file and the UnitTest1.cs to understand the current structure:

Perfect! I can see that the `CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests` project has already been created and initialized with the proper structure. Let me also check the other test projects to ensure they're all set up:

I can see that all the test projects (UnitTests, IntegrationTests, and ComparisonTests) have already been created. However, according to the tasks.md file, task T006 is still marked as not completed (`[ ] T006 [P] Initialize test project CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests in backend/tests/CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests/`).

Since the integration tests project already exists, I'll update the task status in the tasks.md file to mark it as completed. Let me first create a proper task plan file for T006:

Now I need to update the tasks.md file to mark task T006 as completed:

Perfect! Now let me run a build to verify that the integration test project is properly configured and the solution builds correctly:

I need to navigate to the correct directory where the solution file is located:

Let me check the current directory to understand where I am:

I see that I'm at the root directory, and there's a symlinked `backend` folder. Let me now build the solution:

Let me check the actual backend directory structure:

Let me look for the solution file in the actual backend directory:

Let me find the actual backend directory based on the symlink:

Let me check the actual directory structure again more carefully:

Let me check the backend directory in the actual project structure:

Now I'll check the correct backend directory and look for the solution file:

Great! Now I can see the solution file. Let me build it:

Perfect! The solution builds successfully and includes the `CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests` project. I can see that it was built as part of the solution:

```
CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests -> /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/tests/CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests/bin/Debug/net9.0/CaixaSeguradora.IntegrationTests.dll
```

Now I'll summarize what I've done to complete this task:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/.task-plans/task-T006.md (created, 250 lines) - Task plan for initializing integration tests project
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 1 line) - Marked task T006 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed
- dotnet build /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa\ Seguradora/POC\ Cobol/backend/CaixaSeguradora.sln (PASSED - Solution builds successfully including integration tests project)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ Integration test project created with correct name and location
- ✅ Required NuGet packages added for integration testing
- ✅ Project references properly configured to main application projects
- ✅ xUnit test framework properly configured
- ✅ Solution builds successfully including the integration test project
