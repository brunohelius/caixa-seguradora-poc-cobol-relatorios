Let me first read the consolidated task plan file to understand the specific requirements.\n\nIt seems the consolidated task plan file doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to understand what task T010 involves:\n\nNow I understand what task T010 involves. Let me check the current state of the project to see what needs to be done.\n\nLet me first check the backend Infrastructure project and its current NuGet packages:\n\nPerfect! I can see that the Infrastructure project already has the required NuGet packages installed:\n\n1. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` (EF Core 9.0)\n2. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` (SQLite provider)\n3. `System.Text.Json`\n\nLet me mark task T010 as completed in the tasks.md file:\n\nGreat! I've verified that task T010 has already been completed. The Infrastructure project already has the required NuGet packages:\n\n1. Entity Framework Core 9.0 (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore)\n2. SQLite provider (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite) \n3. System.Text.Json\n\nThese are already referenced in the `CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure.csproj` file, so the task is properly marked as completed.\n\n## Files Modified\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 582 lines) - Marked task T010 as completed\n\n## Verification Commands Executed\n- cat backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure.csproj (CONFIRMED - All required packages present)\n\n## Criteria Verified\n- \u2705 EF Core 9.0 packages added: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (9.0.10)\n- \u2705 SQLite provider added: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite (9.0.10)\n- \u2705 System.Text.Json added: System.Text.Json (9.0.10)\n- \u2705 Infrastructure project properly configured with required packages\n\n### Execution Guidance JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"T010\",\n  \"implementation_summary\": \"Verified that the Infrastructure project already has all required NuGet packages (EF Core 9.0, SQLite provider, System.Text.Json) and marked the task as completed in tasks.md\",\n  \"files_modified\": [\n    {\"path\": \"/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md\", \"change_type\": \"modified\", \"description\": \"Marked task T010 as completed\"}\n  ],\n  \"key_changes\": [\"Task T010 status updated from [ ] to [x] in tasks.md\"],\n  \"tests_executed\": [\n    {\"command\": \"cat backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure.csproj\", \"status\": \"PASSED\", \"evidence\": \"Confirmed all required packages present\"}\n  ],\n  \"validation_focus\": [\n    {\"area\": \"NuGet package verification\", \"expectation\": \"All required packages (EF Core 9.0, SQLite provider, System.Text.Json) should be present in Infrastructure project\"}\n  ],\n  \"risks\": [\"None - Task was already completed with correct packages\"]\n}\n```\n",
