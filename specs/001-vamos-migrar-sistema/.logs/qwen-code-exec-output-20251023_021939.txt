I'll help you implement task T010. Let me first read the consolidated task plan file to understand the specific requirements.

It seems the consolidated task plan file doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to understand what task T010 involves:

Now I understand what task T010 involves. Let me check the current state of the project to see what needs to be done.

Let me first check the backend Infrastructure project and its current NuGet packages:

Perfect! I can see that the Infrastructure project already has the required NuGet packages installed:

1. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` (EF Core 9.0)
2. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` (SQLite provider)
3. `System.Text.Json`

Let me mark task T010 as completed in the tasks.md file:

Great! I've verified that task T010 has already been completed. The Infrastructure project already has the required NuGet packages:

1. Entity Framework Core 9.0 (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore)
2. SQLite provider (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite) 
3. System.Text.Json

These are already referenced in the `CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure.csproj` file, so the task is properly marked as completed.

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 582 lines) - Marked task T010 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed
- cat backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure/CaixaSeguradora.Infrastructure.csproj (CONFIRMED - All required packages present)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ EF Core 9.0 packages added: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (9.0.10)
- ✅ SQLite provider added: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite (9.0.10)
- ✅ System.Text.Json added: System.Text.Json (9.0.10)
- ✅ Infrastructure project properly configured with required packages
