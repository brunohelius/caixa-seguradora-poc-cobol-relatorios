Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.\n\nNow I need to check the checklist status before proceeding with the implementation:\n\nLet me check the status of the requirements checklist:\n\nNow let me verify the project setup and check for ignore files:\n\nNow I need to look at the consolidated task plan for task T025:\n\nThe consolidated task plan for T025 doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to see the current task definition:\n\nI see that task T025 is already marked as completed in the tasks.md file. Let me check the current status of the appsettings.Development.json file to see if it needs to be updated:\n\nI can see that the appsettings.Development.json file already exists and contains the SQLite connection string configuration. The task T025 was to \"Configure SQLite connection string for development in `backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json`\", which has already been completed as evidenced by the file content showing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\n    \"DefaultConnection\": \"Data Source=premium-reporting-dev.db\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nI'll update the task status in the tasks.md file to reflect this:\n\n## Files Modified\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json (verified, 11 lines) - Already configured with SQLite connection string\n\n## Verification Commands Executed\n- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json (VERIFIED)\n\n## Criteria Verified\n- \u2705 SQLite connection string configured: \"Data Source=premium-reporting-dev.db\"\n- \u2705 File exists at correct location: backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json\n- \u2705 Task T025 already marked as completed in tasks.md\n\nI've verified that task T025 has already been completed. The `appsettings.Development.json` file exists and contains the SQLite connection string configuration as required. The file has the appropriate connection string for development: `\"DefaultConnection\": \"Data Source=premium-reporting-dev.db\"`.\n\n## Execution Guidance JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"T025\",\n  \"implementation_summary\": \"Verified that the SQLite connection string for development was already configured in appsettings.Development.json file\",\n  \"files_modified\": [\n    {\"path\": \"/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json\", \"change_type\": \"verified\", \"description\": \"File already contains SQLite connection string configuration for development\"}\n  ],\n  \"key_changes\": [\"Confirmed existing SQLite connection string configuration for development environment\"],\n  \"tests_executed\": [\n    {\"command\": \"cat backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Api/appsettings.Development.json\", \"status\": \"VERIFIED\", \"evidence\": \"Connection string found in file\"}\n  ],\n  \"validation_focus\": [\n    {\"area\": \"Configuration file existence\", \"expectation\": \"File exists at correct location with connection string\"}\n  ],\n  \"risks\": [\"No risks - configuration was already properly set up\"]\n}\n```\n",
