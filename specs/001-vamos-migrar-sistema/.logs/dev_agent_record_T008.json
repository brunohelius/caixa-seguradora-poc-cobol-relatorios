  "implementation_output": "I'll help you implement task T008: Add NuGet packages to Api project (Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper). Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.\n\nI'll check the project prerequisites and setup first.\n\nNow let me check the checklist status as required by the implementation workflow:\n\nLet me check the status of the requirements checklist:\n\nGreat! All checklists are complete. Now let me read the consolidated task plan for T008:\n\nThe consolidated task plan for T008 doesn't exist yet. Let me check the tasks.md file to understand the current task:\n\nNow I'll check the project structure to understand the current setup and where I need to add the NuGet packages:\n\nNow I'll check the Api project to see the current packages:\n\nPerfect! I can see that the packages mentioned in task T008 (Swashbuckle, Serilog, AutoMapper) have already been added to the Api project:\n\n1. Swashbuckle: `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` Version=\"9.0.6\"\n2. Serilog: Multiple packages including `Serilog.AspNetCore`, `Serilog.Sinks.Console`, and `Serilog.Sinks.File`\n3. AutoMapper: `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection` Version=\"12.0.1\"\n\nLet me update the task status in the tasks.md file to mark T008 as completed:\n\nNow let me verify what packages are installed by checking the other project files mentioned in the tasks as well:\n\nI'll also check the test projects as mentioned in task T011:\n\nGreat! I've confirmed that the packages for task T008 have already been added to the Api project.
