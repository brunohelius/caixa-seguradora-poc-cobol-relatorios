Let me start by checking the prerequisites and project setup.\n\nI'll check the prerequisites and project setup first.\n\nNow I'll check if there are any checklists that need to be completed:\n\nLet me check the content of the requirements checklist:\n\nGreat! The checklist is complete. Now let me continue with the implementation. I need to verify the project setup and create the .gitignore file for the backend .NET project.\n\nLet me first check if the backend directory exists and understand the project structure:\n\nI see there's already a .gitignore file at the root. Let me check its content:\n\nNow let me check the backend directory structure to see if it needs its own .gitignore file:\n\nI can see that there's already a .gitignore file in the backend directory. Let me check its content:\n\nPerfect! I can see that the backend directory already has a .gitignore file with .NET-specific patterns including bin/, obj/, and *.db as required by task T017. However, let me check the consolidated task plan to see if there are specific requirements for this task:\n\nThe consolidated task plan file doesn't exist. Let me check the tasks.md file to see the details of task T017:\n\nI can see that task T017 is actually already marked as completed in the tasks.md file (it has [x]). Let me double-check the content of the existing .gitignore file to ensure it has all the required patterns mentioned in the task:\n\nThe task required: `Create 'backend/.gitignore' for .NET projects (bin/, obj/, *.db)`\n\nLooking at the current .gitignore file, I can see it already has:\n- `bin/` \u2713\n- `obj/` \u2713 \n- `*.db` \u2713 (along with `*.db-shm` and `*.db-wal` which are related SQLite files)\n\nThe file is already created with all the required patterns. Let me update the task status in the todo list:\n\n## Files Modified\n- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore (verified, 30 lines) - Contains required .NET patterns: bin/, obj/, *.db\n\n## Verification Commands Executed\n- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore (VERIFIED - contains all required patterns)\n\n## Criteria Verified\n- \u2705 .gitignore file exists in backend directory: File contains .NET-specific ignore patterns\n- \u2705 Required patterns present: bin/, obj/, and *.db are all included in the file\n\nThe task T017 was to create a .gitignore file for the backend .NET project with the patterns bin/, obj/, and *.db. I verified that this file already exists at `/Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/.gitignore` and it already contains all the required patterns mentioned in the task. The task was already marked as completed [x] in the tasks.md file.\n",
