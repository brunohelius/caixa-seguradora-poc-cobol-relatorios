I'll execute the implementation for task T021 by creating the CobolFieldAttribute as specified. First, let me check the prerequisites and project setup.

Now I'll check the checklists status to see if there are any incomplete checklists that need to be addressed before implementation.

Let me check the requirements checklist to see if it's complete:

Great! All checklists are complete. Now let me verify the project setup by checking for ignore files:

Now I'll check if .gitignore exists and verify its contents:

Perfect! The .gitignore file exists and is properly configured. Now let me examine the consolidated task plan for T021:

The consolidated task plan doesn't exist yet. Let me check the main tasks file to understand what T021 involves:

Now I need to look at the research.md file to understand the technical requirements for the CobolFieldAttribute:

Let me get more of the research.md file to see the CobolFieldType enum definition:

Let me check the data-model.md file to see how the CobolFieldAttribute is used:

Now let me check if the CobolFieldAttribute file already exists:

I can see that the CobolFieldAttribute already exists but it doesn't match exactly what's described in the research.md. Let me also check if the CobolFieldType enum exists:

Based on the research.md, I need to correct the CobolFieldAttribute to match the specification. Let me update the file to match what's expected in the research document:

I can see that the file already exists, but let me update it to match the specification in research.md:

Now let me update the CobolFieldType enum to match the research.md specification:

Perfect! Now let me verify that the files have been updated correctly. Let me update the todos:

Let me verify that the updates were applied correctly by checking the content of both files:

Perfect! Now let me update the tasks.md file to mark task T021 as completed:

## Files Modified
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldAttribute.cs (modified, 13 lines) - Updated to match research.md specification with PicClause, Length, DecimalPlaces, and FieldType properties
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldType.cs (modified, 9 lines) - Updated enum values to match research.md specification with Display, Numeric, PackedDecimal, and SignedNumeric
- /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/specs/001-vamos-migrar-sistema/tasks.md (modified, 1453 lines) - Marked task T021 as completed

## Verification Commands Executed
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldAttribute.cs (VERIFIED - matches research.md specification)
- cat /Users/brunosouza/Development/Caixa Seguradora/POC Cobol/backend/src/CaixaSeguradora.Core/Attributes/CobolFieldType.cs (VERIFIED - matches research.md specification)

## Criteria Verified
- ✅ T021 completed: CobolFieldAttribute created at specified location with correct implementation
- ✅ Attribute matches specification from research.md R1 with proper properties
- ✅ CobolFieldType enum matches specification with correct enum values and documentation
- ✅ File follows Clean Architecture principles by being in Core layer
