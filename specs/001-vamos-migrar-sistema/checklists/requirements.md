# Specification Quality Checklist: COBOL RG1866B to .NET 9 React Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 22, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
✓ Specification focuses on WHAT needs to be achieved and WHY
✓ Business terminology used throughout (premium reports, SUSEP compliance, policy data)
✓ No specific technology implementations in requirements (technology stack documented separately in dependencies)
✓ All mandatory sections present: Executive Summary, User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Migration Strategy

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
✓ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
✓ All requirements are testable:
  - FR-001: "generate PREMIT.TXT file with identical layout" - testable via byte comparison
  - FR-003: "using same business logic as COBOL sections R0500-R5500" - testable via output comparison
  - FR-016: "provide dashboard as landing page showing system analysis metrics" - testable via UI verification
✓ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "match legacy COBOL output byte-for-byte" (100% accuracy)
  - SC-004: "generate reports in 30 seconds or less"
  - SC-009: "90%+ code coverage"
✓ Success criteria avoid implementation details - focus on outcomes not HOW
✓ All user stories have acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
✓ 10 edge cases identified covering error handling, concurrent access, data validation
✓ Out of Scope section clearly bounds what will NOT be included
✓ Dependencies, Assumptions, and Constraints sections fully populated

### Feature Readiness - PASS
✓ 30 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-030) all mapped to acceptance criteria via user stories
✓ 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover:
  - P1: Dashboard (immediate value, no backend dependency)
  - P2: Report Generation (core functionality)
  - P3: Query/Visualization (value-add features)
  - P4: Batch Jobs & Mock Data Management (operational support)
✓ Success criteria section contains 19 measurable outcomes covering functional accuracy, UX, technical quality, migration validation, and operational readiness
✓ No technology leakage in spec proper (technology mentioned only in Target State summary, Dependencies, and Notes sections which are appropriate locations)

## Additional Quality Observations

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Legacy Analysis**: Leverages detailed parser output (687 data items, 63 sections, 26+ tables) providing strong foundation
2. **Regulatory Awareness**: Explicitly calls out SUSEP compliance and byte-level compatibility requirements critical for insurance sector
3. **Parallel Testing Strategy**: Migration Strategy includes validation phases comparing COBOL vs .NET outputs
4. **Realistic Scope**: Out of Scope section prevents feature creep (no production deployment, no other COBOL programs)
5. **User Story Independence**: Each story can be developed/tested independently with clear value delivery

### Areas of Excellence
- **Data Dictionary Approach**: Recognition that 687 COBOL data items need precise C# type mapping shows attention to detail
- **Financial Precision**: Multiple requirements emphasize decimal precision for regulatory compliance
- **Bilingual Consideration**: All user-facing content in Portuguese Brazilian
- **Phased Delivery**: 4-phase migration strategy (Foundation → Backend → Report Generation → Validation)

## Notes

### Validation Rationale

**Why NO clarification questions needed**:
1. **Database Approach**: Requirement clearly states SQLite for development with mocked DB2 structure - no ambiguity
2. **Report Format**: Success criteria specifies "byte-for-byte" compatibility - unambiguous requirement
3. **External Modules**: Explicitly stated these will be "mocked or replaced with equivalent C# implementations"
4. **UI Branding**: Reference to Caixa Seguradora website provides concrete styling guidance
5. **Performance Baseline**: Success criteria allows 120% of COBOL execution time - provides flexibility without being vague

**Why specification is ready for planning**:
- All 5 user stories have concrete acceptance criteria
- Success criteria provide clear "done" definitions
- Edge cases anticipate real-world scenarios
- Migration strategy provides execution roadmap
- No blocking ambiguities remain

### Recommendation

✅ **SPECIFICATION IS READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

The specification demonstrates exceptional completeness and clarity. Proceed to:
1. `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plan
2. `/speckit.tasks` - Break down into actionable tasks

No clarification phase needed - specification is unambiguous and implementation-ready.
