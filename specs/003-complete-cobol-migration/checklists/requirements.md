# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete COBOL RG1866B Functional Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification focuses on WHAT the system must do (generate SUSEP reports, calculate premiums) rather than HOW to implement. All technical references (C#, React, SQLite) appear only in Assumptions/Constraints where necessary for migration context. Language is accessible to business users.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: Zero clarification markers - all requirements are concrete. Each FR has clear acceptance test in user stories. Success criteria use measurable metrics (byte-for-byte match, processing time < 5 minutes, 100 test cases passing). Edge cases cover database failures, concurrent execution, calculation errors, data quality issues.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 45 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-045) each map to acceptance scenarios in user stories 1-7. Primary flows covered: report generation (P1), premium calculations (P1), business validations (P1), file generation (P1), large dataset processing (P2), external services (P2), web interface (P3). Success criteria include 35 measurable outcomes.

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

**Summary**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete and testable
- Gap analysis clearly identifies what's documented vs not yet implemented
- Focus on actual COBOL functionality (removing non-functional dashboard)
- Comprehensive success criteria with 35 measurable outcomes
- Edge cases cover all major failure scenarios

**Recommendation**: PROCEED TO /speckit.plan

## Specific Strengths

1. **Clear Gap Analysis**: Executive summary explicitly lists what's documented (✅) vs not implemented (❌), providing transparency on migration status

2. **Priority-Driven User Stories**: 7 user stories with P1/P2/P3 priorities allow incremental delivery - P1 stories (generate reports, calculations, validations, file generation) deliver core regulatory functionality

3. **Regulatory Focus**: Emphasizes non-negotiable requirements (byte-for-byte SUSEP compatibility, decimal precision, audit trail) critical for insurance compliance

4. **Realistic Scope**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly removes dashboard and analytics that aren't part of COBOL functionality, keeping focus on functional parity

5. **Measurable Outcomes**: 35 success criteria with specific metrics:
   - SC-001: "byte-for-byte match for 100 production test cases"
   - SC-006: "processes 10,000 records in under 5 minutes"
   - SC-031: "business users validate 50 production months"

6. **Edge Case Coverage**: 10+ edge cases address real production scenarios (database failures, concurrent execution, division by zero, file system full, COMP-3 precision)

7. **Testability**: Each user story has "Independent Test" section showing how it can be validated standalone, supporting incremental development

## Notes

No issues identified. Specification is production-ready and provides clear roadmap for implementing complete COBOL functional migration.
