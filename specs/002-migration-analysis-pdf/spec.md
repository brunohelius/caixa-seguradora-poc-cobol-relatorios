## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Generate Comprehensive Migration Analysis PDF (Priority: P1)

Stakeholders need a comprehensive PDF document that consolidates all technical analysis of the legacy COBOL system, the complete migration plan to .NET with React, function point analysis, and a detailed implementation schedule for presentation to executive leadership and regulatory compliance.

**Why this priority**: This is the deliverable that drives business approval, funding, and regulatory documentation. It provides complete visibility into migration scope, costs, timeline, and approach. Without this document, the project cannot proceed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the PDF generation command, verifying all required sections are present with accurate data, checking document formatting and branding, and confirming all tables, charts, and schedules render correctly. Delivers immediate value by providing complete project documentation for stakeholder review and approval.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user executes the PDF generation tool, **When** the generation completes, **Then** they receive a professionally formatted PDF document containing: executive summary, complete COBOL system analysis (687 data items, 63 sections, 26+ database tables), migration strategy with .NET and React architecture, detailed component and page specifications, function points calculation with pricing (750 BRL per function point), 2-month implementation schedule with weekly breakdown, and 1-month homologation plan with testing milestones.

2. **Given** the PDF is generated, **When** user opens the document, **Then** they see: Caixa Seguradora branding on cover page and headers, professionally formatted table of contents with page numbers, all sections with proper heading hierarchy, technical diagrams showing architecture, data flow charts, database schema visualizations, component hierarchy diagrams, Gantt chart for timeline, and cost breakdown tables.

3. **Given** stakeholders review the document, **When** they examine the migration methodology section, **Then** they find: detailed explanation of the MIGRAI methodology, how LLM frameworks (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) accelerate development, specific migration phases with deliverables, risk mitigation strategies, quality assurance approach, and regulatory compliance validation process.

4. **Given** executive leadership reviews the document, **When** they analyze the financial section, **Then** they see: complete function point breakdown by component (backend API, frontend UI, database migration, integration services), total function points calculation, cost per function point (750 BRL), fixed-price total project cost, payment milestone schedule, and ROI analysis comparing legacy maintenance costs vs. modern platform benefits.

5. **Given** technical team reviews the document, **When** they examine the implementation plan, **Then** they find: week-by-week task breakdown for 8 weeks of development, specific technologies and frameworks to be used, component-level specifications with React component names and props, API endpoint definitions with request/response formats, database schema migration steps, testing strategy for each phase, and deployment architecture.

### User Story 2 - Update PDF with Latest Migration Progress (Priority: P2)

Project managers need to regenerate the PDF document with updated progress metrics, completed tasks, and revised schedules as the migration progresses, maintaining historical versions for audit trail and stakeholder communication.

**Why this priority**: Enables ongoing project communication and progress tracking. Critical for transparency but secondary to initial document generation. Can be implemented after core generation capability exists.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying project metrics (e.g., marking tasks complete, updating function points), regenerating the PDF, and verifying that changes are reflected while maintaining document structure and historical data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** migration is in progress, **When** project manager updates task completion status, **Then** regenerated PDF shows: updated progress bars on Gantt chart, revised completion percentages by phase, actual vs. planned timeline comparison, and color-coded status indicators (green for on-track, yellow for at-risk, red for delayed).

2. **Given** scope changes occur, **When** function points are recalculated, **Then** new PDF includes: change log section documenting scope modifications, updated function point totals with comparison to baseline, revised cost calculations, and impact analysis on timeline and resources.

---

### User Story 3 - Export PDF in Multiple Languages (Priority: P4)

International stakeholders need the migration analysis document in English in addition to Portuguese for cross-border collaboration and consulting partnerships.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature for international collaboration but not critical for initial project approval. Can be added post-MVP if international partnerships materialize.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting language option during PDF generation and verifying all text, labels, and documentation are correctly translated while maintaining technical accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user selects English language option, **When** PDF is generated, **Then** all narrative text, section headings, table labels, and chart legends appear in English while preserving technical terms (COBOL, .NET, React) and numerical data.

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when source documentation files are missing or corrupted?** System validates all required input files exist before generation, displays specific error message identifying missing files ("COBOL analysis report not found at docs/parser/FINAL-ANALYSIS-REPORT.md"), and provides remediation steps to regenerate missing analysis.

- **How does system handle very large analysis datasets (1000+ data items)?** PDF generation uses pagination strategies to break large tables across multiple pages with continued headers, implements collapsible sections in table of contents, and optimizes chart rendering to maintain readability without overwhelming page real estate.

- **What if PDF generation fails midway due to memory constraints?** System implements chunked generation approach processing one section at a time, writes temporary files for each section, and assembles final PDF from chunks. If failure occurs, provides partial output with error log indicating which section failed.

- **How are formatting inconsistencies between sections handled?** Template system enforces consistent styling across all sections with CSS-like style definitions, validates that all tables use same formatting rules, and applies automatic formatting corrections before final PDF assembly.

- **What if function point calculations change after PDF is generated?** Document includes metadata section with generation timestamp, source data version hashes, and baseline values. Regeneration creates new version with change tracking highlighting differences from previous version.

- **How are complex technical diagrams rendered in PDF format?** System uses vector graphics (SVG to PDF conversion) for architecture diagrams ensuring scalability, embeds high-resolution images for screenshots with compression, and provides both inline diagrams and appendix with full-page detailed versions.

- **What happens when timeline data exceeds 2-month planned duration?** Gantt chart dynamically scales to accommodate actual timeline, displays variance indicators showing schedule slippage, and includes contingency planning section explaining impacts and mitigation strategies.

## Notes

### Critical Implementation Considerations

1. **Function Point Calculation Accuracy**: IFPUG methodology must be followed precisely. Each functional area (External Inputs, External Outputs, External Queries, Internal Logical Files, External Interface Files) must be counted separately with appropriate complexity weighting (Low=3-4, Average=4-6, High=5-7 points). Document all assumptions.

2. **Timeline Realism**: 2-month development schedule is aggressive for a 5,000-line COBOL migration. Schedule must account for: COBOL business logic analysis (ongoing), byte-for-byte output validation testing, regulatory compliance verification, and stakeholder review cycles. Build in contingency buffer.

3. **Fixed-Price Risk**: At 750 BRL per function point, total cost is fixed regardless of implementation challenges. Function point count must be comprehensive to avoid underestimating scope. Include risk premium in complexity ratings.

4. **Branding Consistency**: Caixa Seguradora has strict brand guidelines. Logo usage, color codes (#0047BB blue, #FFB81C yellow), and typography must match corporate standards exactly. Obtain brand guidelines document.

5. **Chart Quality**: Gantt charts must show task dependencies clearly using precedence diagram method (PDM). Critical path should be highlighted. Chart legend must explain symbols. Ensure charts are readable when printed in grayscale.

6. **LLM Methodology Documentation**: MIGRAI methodology section must explain how Claude Code and GitHub Copilot are used for: COBOL-to-C# translation, unit test generation, documentation generation, and code review. Include productivity metrics and quality safeguards.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: Insurance industry documentation must withstand SUSEP audit scrutiny. Include: traceability from COBOL business rules to .NET implementation, validation approach for calculation accuracy, data integrity controls, and compliance certification plan.

8. **Version Control**: Document must include version history table showing: version number, generation date, author, change summary, and approval status. Each regeneration increments version number.

### Known Limitations

1. **Function Point Subjectivity**: Function point counting involves judgment calls on complexity. Different counters may arrive at slightly different totals (±10% variance is normal). Document all complexity assumptions.

2. **Schedule Dependencies**: 2-month timeline assumes: full-time dedicated resources, no scope changes, immediate stakeholder feedback, and no external blockers. Real-world projects often face delays.

3. **PDF Static Nature**: Document is point-in-time snapshot. As migration progresses, document becomes outdated. Recommend regeneration at each major milestone.

4. **Translation Complexity**: Portuguese-to-English translation (if implemented) may lose technical nuance. Recommend professional translation review for critical documents.

5. **Chart Rendering**: Complex Gantt charts with 50+ tasks may be difficult to read in PDF format. Consider providing interactive HTML version as supplement.
