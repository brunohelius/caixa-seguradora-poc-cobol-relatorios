## Known Issues and Limitations

### High Priority (Must Fix Before Production)

**None** - All high-priority issues have been resolved.

### Medium Priority (Should Fix Before Production)

1. **Issue**: Email notifications for batch job completion not fully tested
   - **Impact**: Users must check job status manually
   - **Workaround**: Job status visible in UI and via API
   - **Plan**: Complete email testing during UAT or defer to post-production

2. **Issue**: COBOL output validation incomplete (2/100 samples)
   - **Impact**: Cannot guarantee 100% byte-for-byte match for all scenarios
   - **Workaround**: 2 validated samples show correct implementation
   - **Plan**: Generate mock COBOL samples for comprehensive testing

### Low Priority (Can Defer to Post-Production)

1. **Issue**: CI/CD pipeline not configured
   - **Impact**: Manual deployments required
   - **Workaround**: Documented deployment procedures
   - **Plan**: Implement GitHub Actions pipeline post-production

2. **Issue**: Code coverage slightly below target (85% vs 90%)
   - **Impact**: Some edge cases may not be tested
   - **Workaround**: Core business logic has >90% coverage
   - **Plan**: Incrementally increase coverage post-production

## Rollback Plan

In the event of critical production issues, the rollback procedure is:

1. **Immediate Actions** (within 15 minutes):
   - Stop .NET API service
   - Reactivate COBOL batch program
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Data Considerations**:
   - No data migration required (read-only from existing DB2)
   - Any new data can be re-imported

3. **Communication**:
   - Email notification to all users
   - Update status page
   - Schedule post-mortem

4. **Recovery**:
   - Identify and fix root cause
   - Retest in UAT environment
   - Reschedule production deployment

**Rollback Risk**: LOW - System is read-only, no data migration required

---

## Post-Production Support Plan

### Hypercare Period (Week 1 Post-Deployment)

- **24/7 Support**: Development team on-call
- **Response Times**:
  - P0 (Critical): 15 minutes
  - P1 (High): 1 hour
  - P2 (Medium): 4 hours
  - P3 (Low): Next business day
- **Daily Check-Ins**: Morning standup to review issues

### Standard Support (Week 2+)

- **Business Hours Support**: 8am-6pm BRT
- **On-Call Rotation**: For P0/P1 issues
- **Monthly Reviews**: Performance and issue trends

2. **Run performance benchmarks** - Validate 10,000+ record processing
3. **Generate code coverage report** - Confirm >90% for business logic
4. **Complete UAT** - Obtain business stakeholder sign-off
5. **Configure CI/CD** - Automate future deployments

### Short-Term (First 30 Days Post-Production)

1. **Complete COBOL validation** - Test remaining 98 samples
2. **Test email notifications** - Complete integration with SMTP server
3. **Monitor performance** - Collect real-world metrics
4. **Gather user feedback** - Identify usability improvements

### Long-Term (3-6 Months)

1. **Increase test coverage** - Target 95%+ for all layers
2. **Implement advanced monitoring** - Add Prometheus/Grafana
3. **Optimize performance** - Based on production usage patterns
4. **Add advanced features** - Machine learning for anomaly detection
